# WHAT IS VANILLA HOLO HUD?
This is a Garry's Mod HUD for ACF vehicles written in Wiremod's Expression2 language.

This project requires two addons to work in-game:
* [ACF](https://github.com/nrlulz/ACF)
* [Wiremod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=160250458)

## INSTALLATION
Download the Project and install into:

C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\GarrysMod\garrysmod\

## IN-GAME USAGE
Inside the Expression2 is a tutorial and default config included.

## FEATURES
* Features an Intro Sequence, 3D compass, GTMP Minimap Support, a backup camera, support for any screen resolution, and many more...

* Flexible support for any vehicle type (including Mechs, land or air vehicles), and support for 1 primary/secondary gun & 2 Counter-measures

* Designed with Immersion & Simplicity in-mind. If you are like me and you hate seeing HUD elements
while seeing the instruments inside your vehicle, there are many options to make the HUD appear as you see fit in FirstPerson & ThirdPerson
